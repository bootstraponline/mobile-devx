# Idea name

## Introduction

A short description of what the feature is. Try to keep it to a
single-paragraph "elevator pitch" so the reader understands what
problem this proposal is addressing.

## Motivation

Describe the problems that this proposal seeks to address. If the
problem is that some common pattern is currently hard to express, show
how one can currently get a similar effect and describe its
drawbacks.

## Proposed solution

Describe your solution to the problem. Provide examples and describe
how they work. Show how your solution is better than current
workarounds: is it cleaner, safer, or more efficient?

## Detailed design

Describe the design of the solution in detail. If it's a new API, show 
the full API and its documentation comments detailing what it does. 
The detail in this section should be sufficient for someone who is *not*
one of the authors to be able to reasonably implement the feature.

## Benefit

## Risk

## References

Links to supporting videos, blog posts, etc.

## Alternatives considered

Describe alternative approaches to addressing the same problem, and
why you chose this approach instead.
